Regarding Figure S12b.
Reviewer: "Spatial variability could be as large as the interannual variability"

What we originally wrote: "The magnitude of NCP was similar among floats that overlapped in time."

We run a linear mixed-effects model with year and float ID as random effects. 

Results: most of the variability is attributed year-to-year changes, not spatial (at the float level) differences. (The model associated zero variance to float ID). 

```{r}
S12b <- read.delim("aNCP_export_spring_summer.txt", sep = " ")

# Linear mixed-effects model
library(lme4)
library(Matrix)
model.S12b <- lmer(aNCP_carbon_unit ~ (1 | year) + (1 | WMOID), data = S12b)
summary(model.S12b)
```

Year is a major driver of the recorded aNCP variability, since the std.dev is ~0.9.
float ID does not explain any additional variance. (The Variance is 0.0000) -> NCP is similar among floats that overlap in time.
